# Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Neural Networks

The ability of a computer to receive and
interpret legible handwriting input from sources such
as paper documents, pictures, touch-pads and displays,
and other devices is referred to as handwritten recognition.
The applications of optical character recognition
(OCR) and handwritten character recognition (HCR)
are numerous. For this project, I have considered MNIST dataset. I have used CNN, FFNN and Multilayer
perceptron. Using these models, I got good testing  accuracies. From these three models, I get testing accuracy of
92.22% from Multi-layer perceptron, 96.48% has been
achieved by Convolution Neural Network, and 97.61%
got from the Feed Forward Neural Network. So, FFNN
has been outperformed the other two models.

## Installation

I have done my code in google colaboratory. To run this program, you can download the .ipynb file. 
And open it into the google colaboratory. There is no further action required! 
    
## Usage

Usage of the project is, checking which neural network gives more accuracy, and better and accurate results.
Below there is images of the accuracy for the different models:

1) Convolution Neural Network:

## Roadmap

- Make custom dataset and perform experiments on it

- Improve Model accuracy and I will used different models.

- I will look forward to build GUI for this project

  
## Acknowledgements

- I would want to convey my appreciation to Dr. Trevor
  Tomesh, without whose assistance, I would not have
  been able to complete this study. I am grateful to him
  since he provided appropriate research direction and
  information, as well as assistance by offering feedback
  on my research work.

## Project Status

So, this project is not completed yet, there are some modifications also needed, and I will try to implement GUI for this project. And also, implement different models for this to get better accuracies for the real-time experiments.
